The guy living in my old flat contacted me.. He received another big trash-can full of destroyed and partially empty envelopes.
Seems like that nearly half of the shipped parcels (from two shipping waves) were included.. :fontawesome-regular-angry:

Started talking to my local post office once the first of you received an envelope in really bad condition!
Finally, they gave me some coupons and a special offer to add tracking to international shipments! At least for the EU, let's see how far we can get..

Still re-ordering all the envelopes, tracking back to the original orders and testing+repacking those things..

Some of you guys already mentioned that you received them in nearly the same condition.. Most of the are already re-shipped!

I have to sort those envelopes, test the remaining devices again and see where we get and how fast we can re-pack them!
